How To run
==============
Running the Starter Code should be Fairly Simple

Implementation
==============
We've implemented checkpoint 1 with select function. Connection is persistent. Server could accept new connection
while dealing with requests.
We've implemented checkpoint 2 and achieve GET, POST and HEAD function HTTP compliant. The server can handle multiple
status such like 404,500. On 202, the server could process a GET request from browser and retrieve it from its local system.
The server could also handle some malformed requests, which should receive 500 as return.



Biggest Problem
===============
Memory corruption is our biggest problem which usually happen in concurrent calls. Since the memory of many
data structure is dynamically allocated, some memory blocks are overlapped or accessed after being released
when one request come into one anthoer. We tried use fixed memory which make it slightly better. But the problem still
happen sometime. We would like to know a better solution.
